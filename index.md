# Welcome!

Welcome to the NELLAB wiki page! This wiki is meant as a resource for students in the [NELLAB](https://wp.nyu.edu/nellab/) to help in running, preprocessing, and analyzing MEG data using common lab practices. This wiki is written and run by the graduate students of the [Neuroling](https://wp.nyu.edu/neurolinglab/people/lab-members/) and [MorphLab](https://wp.nyu.edu/morphlab/lab-members/) research groups. Note that this wiki is still a work in progress.

If you have any questions please contact the current [maintainer of wiki](https://www.pophristic.com/).
