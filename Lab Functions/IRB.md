The current lab manager is in charge of IRB approvals. In case there is no lab manager, you will have to submit materials for approval yourself. 

Between Liina and Alec, we have 4 IRB protocols (as of Spring 2023): 
1. "Online language judgment": All online experiments 
2. "Language processing study": In-person behavioral experiments 
3. "MEG investigation of language comprehension and production": Liina's MEG/fMRI protocol 
4. "MEG study of psychophysics and language processing": Alec's MEG/fMRI protocol 

Each of these protocols has a unique NYU-internal ID. You can ask the lab manager or Alec/Liina for these IDs if you need them. 

Almost all MEG/Online experiments are already covered by these four protocols. Once you are approved for a protocol, you can run experiments. The consent forms for these protocols are relatively general and can be used for most experiments in the lab. If you are translating a consent form or creating new recruitment material—you must get that approved by the IRB. For more details see below. 

You can access your IRB protocols through the NYU Cayuse portal: [https://nyu.cayuse.com/rs/irb/](https://nyu.cayuse.com/rs/irb/#dashboard). To access the relevant protocols, you have to have completed your [CITI training](https://www.nyu.edu/research/resources-and-support-offices/getting-started-withyourresearch/human-subjects-research/tutorial.html). 

# Uploading New Materials for a Protocol

If we have a lab manager, you can send relevant documents to them to be upload. If you need to upload anything yourself, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have access to the protocol via NYU Cayuse. If you do not, contact the lab manager or Alec/Liina
