Details
MRI Subject: file path to MRI folder with subfolders for different subjects
We usually don't have MRI's of our subjects. So instead we use the FSaverage, an average headshape (XYZ more info needed). Create a copy of the FSaverage files in your mri folder for the project. The FSaverage MRI files can be found in XYZ.
Digitization Source: path to .fif file of your experimental data
