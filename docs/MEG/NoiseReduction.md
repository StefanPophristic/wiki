# Noise Reduction

Noise reduction is done using the MEG 160 program. It can be found on the desktop computer that we use to record the participant in the MEG Lab or on one of the computers in the lab. Noise reduction is XYZ.

What is this process doing exactly?

How many electrodes do we have? Where are they?


**Include Images on how to do it**


# Reporting

```
MEG data from each participant were first cleaned of environmental electromagnetic noise using the Continuously Adjusted LeastSquares Method (Adachi, Shimogawara, Higuchi, Haruta, & Ochiai, 2001) basedondatacollectedatthreereference channels placed away from the head. [Flick et al. 2021]
```

```
The procedures used for preprocessing first involved removing noise from the raw data by exploiting eight magnetometer reference channels located away from the participantsâ€™ heads; using the Continuously Adjusted Least Squares Method (CALM; Adachi, Shimogawara, Higuchi, Haruta, & Ochiai, 2001), with MEG160 software (Yokohawa Electric Corporation and Eagle Technology Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).
