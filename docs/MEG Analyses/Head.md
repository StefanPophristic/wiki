In this section we will describe and document some of the most commonly used analysis methods in MEG. Be aware that the exact analysis method you will use for your experiment is highly dependent on the exact questions your experiment is trying to answer, the type of data you have collected, and what your goal of the project is. So rather than tell you exactly how to do something, this section is meant to give you ideas on what types of analyses exist, how to begin implementing them in MNE python, and what considerations need to be taken into account when conducting these analyses.

# Time Domain

## ANOVA Models

## Linear Regression Models

## fROI and the Tarkiainen Localizer


# Time-Frequency Analyses

This is a set of analysis methods that our lab doesn't use as often. A time-frequency analysis is an analysis that focuses on the power (amplitude squared) of your signal across different frequencies binned into snippets of time, rather than looking at how your overall amplitude develops over time. Different frequencies have been associated with various processing affects, and decomposing signals in this way can illuminate differences in neural processing even when a time-domain analysis shows no effects.

Since these methods haven't been used to as great of an extent in the lab, this section is currently just an overview. Feel free to split it up into multiple sub-sections if you have more to add!
