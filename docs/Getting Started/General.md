Given the type of work we do, there are many tools we use to help us in coding and general organization. The choice of which tools to use varies from student to student—but here we have compiled some of our favorites. Before starting your first project we recommend skimming through these tools to get an idea of what might be helpful as you work!

# Tools that we highly recommend

## Python package Manager

For our standard preprocessing/analysis pipeline, we use various python packages that have different requirements for Python—requirements that are often at odds from eachother. In order to keep things clean, we recommend installing an environment management system on the computer on which you will be running your preprocessing/analyses (i.e. usually your lab desktop). 

An environment management system enables you to create a local environment where you can download any (python) packages—and these packages won't appear anywhere else outside of the environment in your computer. This way, if you download a specific version of a package in your preprocessing environment, that version will not affect a different version of the same package in your analysis environment. 

We like to use one of the following environemnt systems:
- Conda
- Aline??

We recommend creating two environments: one for coregistration, and one for preprocessing/analysis in MNE. You can find the yaml files that can be used to create these environments in XYZ. 

Tutorials for creating environements can be found: [here for conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html). 

## Tools for running Python
- jupyter notebooks for Python scripts  (I like having these on my local machine for any coding I do in python)
- VS Code versus Atom versus Simone's favorite

# Other Tools

Other tools that we grad students love that have helped us get through grad school:
- Setting up LaTeX in VS Code / Overleaf
- Obsidian (Nigel's Rec) vs. Notes? (Aline's favorite)
- Zotero (link to LANYU resources)
