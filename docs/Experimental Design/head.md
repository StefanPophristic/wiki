Experimental design varies greatly depending on the specific questions and methods you are using. In this section we quickly recap some considerations for experimental designs that we use most often in this lab. 


# Lexical Decision Tasks

Lexical decision tasks, or LDT, are a conceptually very simple experimental task that has a long history in testing psycho- and neuro-linguistic questions at the lexical and morphological levels. The task consists of seeing a single word on the screen and having to respond whether it is an existing or non-existing word in your language. Behaviorally, this gives you two dependent variables: response time and accuracy. Despite its simplicity, there are several important decisions to make when designing the task. 

**Stimuli**: The choice of stimuli depends on your question. However, when working with an LDT you want to make sure that your stimuli are balanced between real and non-words, otherwise participants can induce probabilities of seeing a real word based on real/non-real word ratios and start responding before they actually see the stimulus. Likewise, if running an auditory LDT, you may want to create nonwords that are clearly only nonwords near the end rather than start of the word, to encourage participants to listen to as much of the word as possible before responding. 

**Modality**: In simple LDTs, you have a choice between presenting stimuli visually or auditorily. Note that recording auditory stimuli is much more labor intensive. This choice really depends on the specific question you are asking. 

**Priming**: Priming is a modulation of a behavioral effect from seeing two stimuli, one after the other, that share a specified property. This can be at the phonological level (e.g. rhyme prime), morphological level (e.g. XXX), or semantic level (e.g. XXX). Priming can be cross-model (showing the prime in one modality and the target in another), or the prime and target pairs can have interveners. 

**Fixation Crosses and ISI**: Another decision that must be made is whether to include a fixation cross between trials and how much time to leave between the fixation cross and proceeding stimulus. Some studies choose a fixed ISI while other generate a random ISI online during the study. If you do not have a priming manipulation, the exact choice will most likely not have a huge effect. However, here are a few studies and their relative decisions. Some studies do not use a fixation cross, in which cases ISI (intra-stimulus interval) times are reported. (NR = not reported):
