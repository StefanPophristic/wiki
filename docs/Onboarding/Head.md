Welcome to the lab! Be sure to ask the lab manager/admin staff to get access to the following tools you will need:

- Building Access
    - For access to the 6th floor spaces: Take your ID or send your N-Number and net-ID to Teresa Leung (teresa.leung@nyu.edu)
    - For access to the MEG lab and the Psych building after hours, contact (erica.feeney@nyu.edu)
- Access to the MEG scheduling google calendar
- Be added to the NELLAB and NYU MEG Center Slacks
- Be added to the lab Wiki as a contributor
- Be given access to the lab server (see page on lab server for details)
- Set up access to the HPC (see page on HPC for details)
- Human Subjects Training (https://www.nyu.edu/research/resources-and-support-offices/getting-started-withyourresearch/human-subjects-research/tutorial.html)
- Ask Lab Manager or Alec/Liina to be added to relevant IRBs (see `Lab > Lab Functions > IRB` for more details)
- For using the MEG, you must now complete NYU Scishield training for handling hazardous materials (don't worry we don't actually handle anything hazardous when running participants). Link can be found [here](https://www.nyu.edu/life/safety-health-wellness/research-and-laboratory-safety/scishield-resources.html) and [here](https://nyu.scishield.com/)
    - Create an account
    - Let the current manager of the MEG center know to add you to the relevant tutorials (ask Alec/Liina/Lab Manager/another student who to ask for this)



This section of the lab wiki will give you quick tutorials on how to set up various tools that we use in the lab. We recommend skimming through these pages at some point just to get a sense of the types of tools that may be helpful as you are getting started!
