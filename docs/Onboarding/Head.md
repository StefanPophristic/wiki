Welcome to the lab! Be sure to ask the lab manager/admin staff to get access to the following tools you will need:

- Be added to the lab Wiki as a contributor

This section of the lab wiki will give you quick tutorials on how to set up various tools that we use in the lab. We recommend skimming through these pages at some point just to get a sense of the types of tools that may be helpful as you are getting started!
